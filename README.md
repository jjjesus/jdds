A pure Java implementation of the OMG Data Distribution Service

An attempt to implement some of the OMG DDS Suite of Standards in pure Java. See the link below for details.

http://www.omg.org/spec/

This is a little hobby project I started to pass the time, so there is no planned release schedule. The primary aim is to gain a better understanding of the underlying workings of DDS and hopefully implement something useful in the process.

Suggestions and contributions are welcome.
